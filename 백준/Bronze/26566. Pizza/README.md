### 문제 설명

<p>There’s a pizza store which serves pizza in two sizes: either a pizza slice, with area A1 and price P1, or a circular pizza, with radius R1 and price P2. You want to maximize the amount of pizza you get per dollar. Should you pick the pizza slice or the whole pizza?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input will contain a single integer n that indicates the number datasets to follow. Each dataset is comprised of two lines. The first line contains two space-separated integers A1 and P1. Similarly, the second line contains two space-separated integers R1 and P2. It is guaranteed that all values are positive integers at most 10<sup>3</sup>. We furthermore guarantee that the two will not be worth the same amount of pizza per dollar.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each data set, print on a single line, either “Whole pizza” or “Slice of pizza” depending on which is the better deal.</p>
