### 문제 설명

<p>You are surrounded by Imperial warships and must land on a planet to escape. Your best chance is to find a route to the closest planet. Unfortunately the navigation system has been damaged. Your job is to write a program that will find the planet that is closest to your current location. Recall that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">dist = ( (x1 - x2)<sup>2</sup> + (y1 - y2)<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup></p>

### 입력 

 <p>A positive integer, n, followed by n pairs of integers (x,y). Each pair will be on a separate line and there will be a space between x and y. The first pair will be the coordinates of your current location and all subsequent pairs will be the coordinates of the planets you can escape to.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Coordinates of your current location, coordinates of a closest planet, and the distance to that planet formatted to two decimal places. The distance must be accurate to two decimal places.</p>
